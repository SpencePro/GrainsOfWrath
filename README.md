# GrainsOfWrath
 This is a small website for a hypothetical restaurant/brewpub called Grains of Wrath. The name and logo come from my father's  retirement business, for which an LLC was registered. However, the business was never realized, as family obligations kept him occupied  until he moved to Kansas for retirement, and by that point the spark had gone.   So, I decided to take the existing logo and name, and re-imagine it as a trendy microbrewery and gastropub for my first website project. I will continue to modify/update the website, adding backend capabilities, Javascript, etc. Perhaps I will completely revamp the design  and aesthetic, and create multiple versions. Who knows?
